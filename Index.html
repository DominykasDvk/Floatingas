    <div class="floatingtext"><p>Wolfenstein is a series of World War II video games. It was originally created by Muse Software, before being revived by id Software. The first two games in the series, Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, were developed by Muse Software and focused on stealth-based gameplay from a top-down perspective. Beginning with id Software's Wolfenstein 3D, Wolfenstein games became fast-paced first-person shooters, and are widely regarded to have helped popularize the first-person shooter genre. Further games in the series include Return to Castle Wolfenstein, developed by Gray Matter Interactive, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory by Splash Damage, and 2009's Wolfenstein by Raven Software. After ZeniMax Media acquired id Software, including the Wolfenstein franchise, Swedish developer MachineGames became the series' primary developer.One advanced diverted domestic sex repeated bringing you old.

    <div class="floatingtext2"><p>The majority of the games follow William "B.J." Blazkowicz, a Jewish Polish-American Army Captain and his fights against the Axis powers. Earlier titles are centered around Nazis attempting to harness supernatural and occult forces. Those developed by MachineGames are set in an alternate history in which Axis powers won World War II. Game is played from the first person perspective, where the player's task is to perform a retrieval missions, sabotages or assassinations. Player can be armed with a typical WW2 weaponry and can even use some fictional ones such as German-made minigun or Tesla gun. Player can also use stealth to eliminate the enemies, and some missions even force using it. Enemies vary from the standard soldiers to the undead and experimental creatures. Health is replenished by collecting health packs and food. Armor also can be collected for an additional protection.One advanced diverted domestic sex repeated bringing you old.

    <div class="floathalf"><p>A loose sequel to Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the start of a new era for the franchise. An agent for the fictional Office of Secret Actions, William "B.J." Blazkowicz, discovers an unnatural medallion containing supernatural powers while on a mission on a German battleship. Learning the Nazis had begun digging deep into crystal mines to obtain more of the very same medallion Blazkowicz found, the OSA sends their operative to the fictional town of Isenstadt, which the Nazis had taken complete control of in order to excavate rare Nachtsonne crystals necessary to access the "Black Sun" dimension.</p></div>

    <div class="floathalf1">
    <p>Set five months after the events of The New Order, "B.J." Blazkowicz awakens from the coma he succumbed to in the aftermath of surviving a near-fatal explosion, residing on a stolen Nazi U-boat commandeered by the Wiesenau Kreis. After an attack ensues on the base orchestrated by Frau Engel, many of the resistance members are captured, and the leader of the group is killed. Escaping the clutches of Nazi forces with the rest of the team, Blazkowicz takes over the leadership of the Resistance and proceeds to what would have been the next step in the plan to liberate America from the Nazis and use the country as a center base to free the rest of the world from their behemoth and monstrous regime.</p></div>

    <div  class="clear"><p>The Wolfenstein series of video games started with the 1981 stealth-adventure video game Castle Wolfenstein. It was developed by American programmer Silas Warner, a pioneer in the early eras of video gaming, especially the stealth genre. It was published by his then company M.U.S.E. Inc. (Muse Software). Set during World War II, the game focuses on an unnamed American prisoner of war who has been imprisoned in the German stronghold of Castle Wolfenstein. The objective is to retrieve the war plans for Operation Rheingold and escape the fortress, while avoiding or killing guards along the way. The game is often credited as one of the first video games of the stealth genre, since it focuses more on avoiding or disarming enemies, and killing them is considered a last resort.</p></div>
